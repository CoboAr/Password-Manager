## What is Password Manager application?
Password Manager is an application that allows users to create, and save their passowrds for local applications or online services such as social media, online shops, web applications, etc. It is implemented with tkinter python library.

## How does it work?
Step 1: User enters the name of the website that wants to create a password, or retrieve it if it is already created. 

Step 2: User enters the email address associated with the password.   

Step 3: User clicks Generate Password. A random password consisting in 8-10 letters, 2-4 symbols, and 2-4 numbers will be generated and copied automatically. 

Step 4: User can simply paste it by right clicking the mouse button and then paste or by using a shortcut command (commad + v) for mac.    

Step 5: If the user has already created a password for that specific website before and just want to use it, the user can simply click Search after entering website name. A popup will show up with email and password information for that specific website.
